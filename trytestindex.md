<p>We are an enthusiastic group of ecology and environmental science students and researchers from the University of Edinburgh. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn. We believe that coding can be really fun and also understand the importance of quantitative skills for professional development.</p>

<p>Over the last four years we have been writing <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> as well as organising in-person workshops. All of our materials are free for people to use and adapt - you can find more information on organising your own workshops or using Coding Club tutorials in your teaching <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/involve.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of knowledge. Coding Club is a place that brings people together, regardless of their gender or background. We all have the right to learn, and we believe learning is more fun and efficient when we help each other along the way.</p>

<h2><b>Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists</b> - a free online course</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course" target="_blank">Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists</a> is an online learning initiative for anyone wanting to gain data science skills in the programming language R, with additional content in Python and JavaScript. Our motivation is to overcome "code fear" and "statistics anxiety" in learners of all ages and from all walks of life. This course is developed for international audiences, but is also uniquely Scottish with real-world data to put quantitative skills into the context of key ecological questions.</b></p>

<p>The three course themes introduce learners to key elements of data science - ‘<a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/stats-scratch/index.html" target="_blank">Stats from Scratch</a>’, ‘<a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/wiz-viz/index.html" target="_blank">Wiz of Data Vis</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/mastering-modelling/index.html" target="_blank">Mastering Modelling</a>’. The 16 individual tutorials that make up the course, in addition to the further 25 tutorials hosted by <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html" target="_blank">Coding Club</a>, allow learners to create their own bespoke learning pathway to gaining key skill sets. Quizzes and challenges test knowledge, but also allow users to join a larger community of learners and gain confidence in their own skills. Join the hundreds of thousands of Coding Club users and develop your data science skills through this entirely free and engaging online learning initiative!</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Coding Club was jumpstarted with support from an <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/development-alumni/iig" target="_blank">Innovation Initiative Grant</a> from the Edinburgh Fund at the University of Edinburgh. We organised our first joint workshop with the University of Aberdeen with the help of a GESA Innovation Initiative Grant. We took Coding Club further with the help of a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/march-2017/coding-club" target="_blank">Principal's Teaching Award Scheme grant</a>. We are working together with the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Partnership</a> which supports some of our team members. Our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course" target="_blank">Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists course</a> is funded by <a href="https://www.thedatalab.com" target="_blank">the Data Lab</a> in Scotland.</p>
